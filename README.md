The .pbit file can be opened in Power BI Desktop and is used to showcase the revenue trends of a company over time. Total revenue, as well as the revenue earned by each market, is shown, as well as the top 5 highest revenue customers and products. Trends about each customer and product, as well as trends from specific months or years, can be viewed as well. Publishing it requires a work email and can't be done with a personal email, so the template has been uploaded instead for now.
